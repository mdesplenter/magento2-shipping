### Webhook endpoint

DPD calls back on this endpoint after async label generation:

```
POST /rest/V1/dpd-shipping/callback
```

No Magento authentication is required (`<resource ref="anonymous"/>`). The callback payload contains the job ID, parcel numbers, label data (fetched separately), and error information.

## ❓ FAQ

**I get a "Bad credentials" error when printing a label.**

> If you use `env.php` to specify credentials, use `bin/magento config:sensitive:set` to set the password — it must be stored encrypted.
> ```bash
> bin/magento config:sensitive:set dpdshipping/account_settings/password "yourpassword"
> ```

**DPD Fresh / Freeze orders fail when creating a shipment.**

> Fresh and Freeze products can only be shipped through the DPD order overview or the packages screen. Standard Magento shipment creation is blocked by design to ensure expiration dates and product descriptions are filled in correctly.

**Labels are not appearing after async batch processing.**

> Check **Sales → DPD → Batches** for the job status. If jobs show `failed`, verify the webhook URL is publicly accessible:
> `https://your-store.com/rest/default/V1/dpd-shipping/callback`

**Saturday delivery is not showing at checkout.**

> The Saturday carrier has a configurable display window. Go to **Stores → Configuration → Sales → Shipping Methods → DPD Saturday** and check the "Shown from" and "Shown till" day/time settings.
